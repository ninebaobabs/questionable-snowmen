questionable-snowmen
====================

a simple ludum dare game about knocking hats of snowmen


Simple sort of Binding of Isaac clone made for LD31. Basically an excuse to practice from scratch some of the windows platform stuff I've been learning following along with Handmade Hero.

In the wierd chance you actually want to build the source, it's pretty simple, check out build.bat in the code directory.
